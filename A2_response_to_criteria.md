Overview
------------------------------------------------

- **Name:** Niam Nayani
- **Student number:** n11051337
- **Partner name (if applicable):**
- **Application name:** Fractal Generator
- **Two line description:** I implemented this very cool app that generates fractal images based on the users parameter inputs.

------------------------------------------------

### Core - First data persistence service

- **AWS service name:** S3
- **What data is being stored?:** Fractal images generated by the user
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:**  Object storage is ideal for large, static binary files like images, offering high scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness.
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:** RDS and DynamoDB are not optimised for storing or serving large binary objects efficiently due to their design for structured data and item size limitations.
- **Bucket/instance/table name:** n11051337-a2-fractals
- **Video timestamp:** 00:00
- **Relevant files:**
    - src/services/s3Service.js
    - src/services/awsConfigService.js
    - src/routes/fractal.js

### Core - Second data persistence service

- **AWS service name:** PostgreSQL
- **What data is being stored?:** Structured metadata, including fractal generation parameters, fractal hashes, S3 keys for stored images, user history entries, and gallery item details.
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:** Ideal for structured data requiring complex  queries, relationships, and transactional integrity.
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:** S3 lacks relational  capabilities; DynamoDB is less efficient for complex relational queries and integrity constraints.
- **Bucket/instance/table name:**
    - fractals
    - history
    - gallery
- **Video timestamp:**00:52
- **Relevant files:**
    - src/database.js
    - src/models/fractal.model.js
    - src/models/gallery.model.js
    - src/models/history.model.js
    - src/routes/fractal.js
    - src/routes/gallery.js
    - src/routes/history.js

### S3 Pre-signed URLs

- **S3 Bucket names:** n11051337-a2-fractals
- **Video timestamp:** 01:23
- **Relevant files:**
    - src/services/s3Service.js
    - src/routes/fractal.js

### In-memory cache

- **ElastiCache instance name:** n11051337-a2-fractals
- **What data is being cached?:** Lists of fractal gallery entries
- **Why is this data likely to be accessed frequently?:** Gallery listings are a core application feature frequently accessed by users and administrators, making caching beneficial for performance and database load reduction.
- **Video timestamp:** 01:38
- **Relevant files:**
    - src/services/cacheService.js
    - src/services/awsConfigService.js
    - src/routes/fractal.js
    - src/routes/gallery.js

### Core - Statelessness

- **What data is stored within your application that is not stored in cloud data services?:** [eg. intermediate video files that have been transcoded but not stabilised]
- **Why is this data not considered persistent state?:** Temporary fractal image buffers generated in memory before being uploaded to S3.
- **How does your application ensure data consistency if the app suddenly stops?:** S3 object uploads are completed before corresponding metadata is stored in the PostgreSQL database. This prevents database records from pointing to non-existent or incomplete S3 objects.
- **Relevant files:**
    - src/routes/fractal.js
    - src/database.js
    - src/models/fractal.model.js
    - src/models/gallery.model.js

### Graceful handling of persistent connections

- **Type of persistent connection and use:**
- **Method for handling lost connections:**
- **Relevant files:**

### Core - Authentication with Cognito

- **User pool name:** n11051337-a2
- **How are authentication tokens handled by the client?:** Upon successful login, the client receives a JWT (ID Token and/or Access Token) from the backend. The client stores this token (e.g., in local storage or session storage) and includes it in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for subsequent authenticated API requests to the application.
- **Video timestamp:** 01:56
- **Relevant files:**
    -   src/routes/auth.js
    -   src/services/awsConfigService.js
    -   server.js
    -   package.json

### Cognito multi-factor authentication

- **What factors are used for authentication:** Password, Email
- **Video timestamp:** 02:23
- **Relevant files:**
    -   src/routes/auth.js
    -   src/services/awsConfigService.js

### Cognito federated identities

- **Identity providers used:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**

### Cognito groups

- **How are groups used to set permissions?:** 'admin' group members have access to administrative gallery and history routes, and can delete any gallery entry. Other users are restricted.
- **Video timestamp:** 02:44
- **Relevant files:**
    -   src/routes/auth.js
    -   src/routes/gallery.js
    -   src/routes/history.js
